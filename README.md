# Management of Vehicular Traffic Based on Vehicle Flow and Speed Limit
Road traffic congestion has been a typical challenge
for everyone in every country. The roads are built with the width
of a car in mind, but with the increasing flow of vehicles, this
fails to avoid traffic. It is difficult to escape traffic during peak
hours when the highways are operating at full capacity. This
study examines the waiting time and travel time on a route
that intersects with a national highway. Two different situations
are recorded in order to compute the waiting time, travel time,
queue length, and other statistics. To begin with, increasing the
vehicle flow rate from 200 to 300 cars per hour has no effect
on journey time. However, increasing the vehicle flow to 400 and
600 per hour, as well as the speed restriction, increases travel
time, waiting time, and queue length.
